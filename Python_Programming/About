This directory contains a fundamental implementation of a Python program, which involves using Flask, REST API, and Tkinter GUI.

The "main" file serves as the main entry point for the entire application, while the "settings" file is responsible for importing the necessary packages. The "patient" file creates a database for the application, the "api" file creates a REST API, and the "GUI" file creates a single Tkinter interface.
